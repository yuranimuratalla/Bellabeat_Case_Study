## About the Project
I was tasked with conducting a case study, imagining myself to be a marketing analyst for the company, Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. 

## About the Data 
18 datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset could be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and a Google Doc version of my case study can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTE8Q2mIaj4wSJRkBa7InGA6FjErwgekXeoFic5rU0I/edit?usp=sharing)
